<!--
Thanks for taking the time to draft up an issue for the Axon Framework `.github` repository!
Prior to starting off, please read the following:

## Usage Questions

If you are having difficulty using this repository,
 please consider checking Axon's Documentation first if it answers your question: https://docs.axoniq.io
 
When the documentation does not cover the specific question you have, take the following into account:
- GitHub is *not* intended for usages questions, instead:
- Drop a questions on AxonIQ's forum: https://discuss.axoniq.io/
- Or place a new question on StackOverflow, using the `axon` tag.

## Reporting a bug or a feature

Prior to filing an issue, please verify that it's not already reported by someone else.
After that's done, your issue will typically fall under one of the following options:

1. It's a `bug`
2. It's a `feature` request

It is recommended that for either of the three you use one of the prepared issue template.
You can find all three of them [here](https://github.com/AxonFramework/.github/issues/new/choose). 

## None of the above fit!

If you have encountered a use case which is not a question, a feature request, or a bug, feel free to draft your scenario below.

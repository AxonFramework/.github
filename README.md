# Axon Framework project README

This repository reserves the purpose of providing the Axon Framework project's main README.
You can find this README on [https://github.com/AxonFramework](https://github.com/AxonFramework).
So, whenever you visit the Axon Framework GitHub organization page, you are greeted by this explanation.

We intend this README to describe **all** Axon Framework repositories, including other tools within the Axon ecosystem that help out our users.
This description thus includes other projects like:

- [Axon Framework](https://www.axoniq.io/products/axon-framework)
- [Axon Server](https://www.axoniq.io/products/axon-server)
- [AxonIQ Console](https://console.axoniq.io/)
- [Axon IntelliJ IDEA Plugin](https://github.com/AxonFramework/IdeaPlugin)
- [Data Protection Module](https://www.axoniq.io/blog/protect-sensitive-data-in-an-event-sourced-application)

By doing so, we showcase the large picture of what it means to build an Axon application instead of just focusing on the contained repositories.

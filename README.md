# Axon Framework project README

This repository reserves the purpose of providing the Axon Framework project's main README.
You can find this README on [https://github.com/AxonFramework](https://github.com/AxonFramework).
So, whenever you visit the Axon Framework GitHub organization page, you are greeted by this explanation.

We intend this README to describe **all** Axon Framework repositories, including other tools within the Axon ecosystem that help out our users.
This description thus includes other projects like:

- Axon Server
- Inspector Axon
- Axon IntelliJ IDEA Plugin
- Axon Initializr
- Data Protection Module

By doing so, we showcase the large picture of what it means to build an Axon application instead of just focusing on the contained repositories.
